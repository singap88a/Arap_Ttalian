                                   <h3>Air freight</h3>
                                 <img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/air-freight-cargo-plane-loading-trading-goods-airport-con-container-parking-lot-use-shipping-transport-logistic-59590130.jpg" alt="">
                                      <p>  Air freight logistics is the transfer and transport of goods by an air carrier, whether charter or commercial.</p>
                                      <p>  Many people in the logistics industry like this option since products can be sent from commercial and passenger aircraft terminals to any location where a plane can fly and land.  </p>

                                      <p>  Air delivery also provides high-speed, time-sensitive shipment to any location in the world, which is particularly useful to small and medium-sized companies since it allows them to participate in international trade quickly and efficiently.</p>
                                        <p>                                        Moreover, air freight offers the greatest degree of security as airport security controls and supervises every cargo that enters or leaves the country.</p>
                               </p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Sea Freight</h3>
                                 <img src="https://elmahgoub.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/slider-2-1536x864.jpeg" alt="">
                                 <p> One of the most significant advantages of sea freight shipping is that it is inexpensive, particularly when used for long travels. </p> 
                                 <p>Sea freight transportation allows you to send huge amounts of products at once at a substantially lower cost than other means of shipping.</p>
                                 <p> Cargo vessels, for example, can transport an average of 18,000 containers every shipment, indicating that each ship can handle a vast volume of cargo.</p>
                                 <p> Because of the large number of cargo containers on each ship, it is less expensive per container than other modes of transportation. Sea freight shipment, whether full container load (FCL) or less than container load (LCL), is significantly less expensive than transferring comparable amounts of freight by air.</p>

                                  <p>   When selecting a sea freight forwarder, you should examine a few variables to help you choose the best service for your organization. Some forwarders specialize in specific sorts of goods, shipment techniques, or other criteria, so ask potential forwarders what types of shipments they've handled in the past.</p>
